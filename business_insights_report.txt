ASPECT-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: BUSINESS INSIGHTS REPORT
Electronics Reviews During 2021-2022 Inflation Period
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis examined how consumer sentiment toward electronics
products changed during the 2021-2022 inflation period using
aspect-based sentiment analysis.


1. OVERALL SENTIMENT DECLINE
   - Overall sentiment decreased by 0.370 points (50.6%)
   - Change is statistically significant (p = 0.0229)
   - This confirms that inflation period negatively impacted customer perception


2. PRICE SENSITIVITY VS QUALITY PERCEPTION
   - Price sentiment declined by 0.046 (22.5%)
   - Quality sentiment changed by -0.218 (-57.3%)
   - KEY INSIGHT: Customers reacted strongly to prices but quality perception remained relatively stable
   - This critical distinction is invisible in traditional overall sentiment analysis


3. MOST AFFECTED ASPECT: DELIVERY
   - Largest sentiment decline: 0.283
   - Percent change: -166.6%
   - P-value: 0.2999 (not significant)
   - Effect size (Cohen's d): 1.39


4. ACTIONABLE BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS

   A. PRICING STRATEGY
      → Don't reduce quality to cut costs - quality perception remains stable
      → Focus on value messaging and flexible payment options
      → Introduce economy variants while maintaining premium line
   
   B. MARKETING APPROACH
      → Emphasize quality and durability in advertising
      → Highlight total cost of ownership vs. upfront price
      → Target messaging: "Built to last, worth the investment"
   
   C. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
      → Maintain current quality standards
      → Consider value-added features that justify price
      → Avoid cost-cutting that compromises build quality
   
   D. CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION
      → Be transparent about pricing factors (supply chain, materials)
      → Emphasize warranty and long-term value
      → Provide comparison to show value vs. competitors


5. VALUE OF ASPECT-BASED ANALYSIS

   Traditional sentiment analysis would report:
   → "Customer satisfaction decreased 50%"
   → Recommendation: "Improve products to increase satisfaction"
   
   Aspect-based analysis reveals:
   → "Price concern increased 22%, quality perception declined 57%"
   → Recommendation: "Customers still value quality; focus on value messaging"
   
   This granularity prevents costly mistakes like:
   ✗ Reducing quality to lower prices (not addressing the real issue)
   ✗ Generic "improve everything" strategies (unfocused, expensive)
   ✗ Missing that quality remains a competitive advantage
