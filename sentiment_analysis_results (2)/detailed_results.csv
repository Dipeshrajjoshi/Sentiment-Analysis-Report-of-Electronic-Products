"So far the only complaint I have is not with the product but with the policy regarding the product. I had one for just about 2 weeks when I noticed a definite issue staying connected. My wife, who has had her Kindle Fire for months, said her started acting up if she had too many apps on it. I started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. After trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. It did stay connected to our wifi. I contacted Best Buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they can't help, unless you've purchased the extended warranty from them. They said that's Amazon's policy. I contacted Amazon, and after a fairly brief support chat, a new Kindle was on the way to its new home. I've been pleased with it since its arrival. It does most of what I need (email, facebook, minimal web use), saving ""wear & tear"" on my laptop.","so far the only complaint i have is not with the product but with the policy regarding the product. i had one for just about 2 weeks when i noticed a definite issue staying connected. my wife, who has had her kindle fire for months, said her started acting up if she had too many apps on it. i started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. after trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. it did stay connected to our wifi. i contacted best buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they cant help, unless youve purchased the extended warranty from them. they said thats amazons policy. i contacted amazon, and after a fairly brief support chat, a new kindle was on the way to its new home. ive been pleased with it since its arrival. it does most of what i need email, facebook, minimal web use, saving wear tear on my laptop.",4.0,2021-03-10,pre-inflation,0.9321,,,,,0.2264

"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there?

"I've had every Kindle e-reader available. Though it doesn't have all the features available on the Voyage, the Paperwhite is the best. The issue I've had are the emergence of tiny light ""leaks"" emerging from the source through the matte textured page background. They're little pinhole-sized, bright light scattered across the page. It usually begins with just one, or two, and becomes several over time. It's distracting to reading. In a conventional book, it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page. If these little things don't bother you, then it's not an issue. The Paperwhite models don't seem to have this problem as often as the Voyage does. I went through 3 Voyage models before surrendering and returning to the Paperwhite.

"I bought this tablet as a gift for my mother-in-law, who is not very tech-savvy. She already owns a laptop, but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching TV, rather than a whole laptop. She also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. I've owned a couple Amazon tablets before, so I had an idea of how they worked, and I wanted something at a low price point, so I decided on this. So far, she loves it! A couple of important points:-The low price point comes at the cost of hardware. After using my Fire HDX, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. It performed better in basic tasks (loading apps, web browsing, etc) than I expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.-As an Amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of Android, but does NOT have baked-in access to Google services (including the Google Play Store). You will be restricted to Amazon-approved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to Google services yourself. Popular apps like Netflix, Skype, and Facebook are all present, but the selection pales in comparison to native Android.","i bought this tablet as a gift for my motherinlaw, who is not very techsavvy. she already owns a laptop, but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching tv, rather than a whole laptop. she also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. ive owned a couple amazon tablets before, so i had an idea of how they worked, and i wanted something at a low price point, so i decided on this. so far, she loves it! a couple of important pointsthe low price point comes at the cost of hardware. after using my fire hdx, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. it performed better in basic tasks loading apps, web browsing, etc than i expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.as an amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of android, but does not have bakedin access to google services including the google play store. you will be restricted to amazonapproved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to google services yourself. popular apps like netflix, skype, and facebook are all present, but the selection pales in comparison to native android.",5.0,2020-01-12,pre-inflation,0.962,0.15993333333333332,,,,0.13895

"I have to say Alexa has been a great disappointment. Most of the time she doesn't know the answer to anything and tells us that she doesn't understand the question. I thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. We had to sign up for AMAZON Prime and Unlimited Music just to actually listen to decent music. When she does know a command for example like say ""Loop Mode"" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right. There are also a lot of pretty useless skills for her available. We got it at a discounted price thankfully and I also got a Dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price. Dot is even worse at listening to commands than Echo is.","i have to say alexa has been a great disappointment. most of the time she doesnt know the answer to anything and tells us that she doesnt understand the question. i thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. we had to sign up for amazon prime and unlimited music just to actually listen to decent music. when she does know a command for example like say loop mode when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. and then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesnt understand the question no matter how many times you say it. we use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of jeopardy a day. really needs a lot of improvement. ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. sigh if she can only be basic on that answer, there isnt much more she is gonna get right. there are also a lot of pretty useless skills for her available. we got it at a discounted price thankfully and i also got a dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price. dot is even worse at listening to commands than echo is.",3.0,2020-08-15,pre-inflation,0.9067,0.4588,,,,

I tried the roku stick but returned it because it was just too darn slow. I'm completely firetv now and 100 happy with it..What it does: It adds internet/streaming functionality to any tv/monitor with an HDMI port. You can use any of the thousands of paid and/or free apps such as netflix, amazon prime, hulu, plex, news, digital fireplace, etc... There's a ton you can do. With some extra effort you can sideload things like Kodi and 3rd party apps. It's super simple to use, and the image quality can be great if your internet connection is fast.The Good stuff...-Same pricerange as the less capable/less powered Chromecast Roku stick-More ram/memory than the competition(keeps things running smooth)-More storage space than the competition, you can store more apps/games/etc..-You can do some gaming with it, but the firetv box is better suited-So small you can bring it pretty much anywhere with ease.-Simple clean interface.-Lots of games/apps to choose from-The phone app is actually pretty usefulNot as good stuff...-No connections other than usb for power, if you need ethernet/audio in/out, get the box!Read more","update! 111115 more than a year now of using the stick literally every single evening for netflix, and it has been overall very reliable.bottom line this is the best streaming device for the dollarin my humble opinion its cheap, it handles netflixprimehbogoplexgamesa lot more doesnt seem much slower than the full firetv box. i started with a roku2 in the living room which got pushed to the bedroom when i got the firetv box, then the firetv stick replaced the roku2. i tried the roku stick but returned it because it was just too darn slow. im completely firetv now and 100 happy with it..what it does it adds internetstreaming functionality to any tvmonitor with an hdmi port. you can use any of the thousands of paid andor free apps such as netflix, amazon prime, hulu, plex, news, digital fireplace, etc... theres a ton you can do. with some extra effort you can sideload things like kodi and 3rd party apps. its super simple to use, and the image quality can be great if your internet connection is fast.the good stuff...same pricerange as the less capableless powered chromecast roku stickmore rammemory than the competitionkeeps things running smoothmore storage space than the competition, you can store more appsgamesetc..you can do some gaming with it, but the firetv box is better suitedso small you can bring it pretty much anywhere with ease.simple clean interface.lots of gamesapps to choose fromthe phone app is actually pretty usefulnot as good stuff...no connections other than usb for power, if you need ethernetaudio inout, get the box!read more",5.0,2020-07-31,pre-inflation,0.9958,0.80845,0.80845,0.7759499999999999,,0.0

"I bought this on impulse because I had heard great things about it. I have a variety of automated home devices, such as Philips Hue bulbs, and wanted to see if the Echo would help me control everything.I now use the Echo all the time for lights, alarms, and daily news. The best part of the Echo is its ability to recognize multiple voices at different volumes. My parents also use it and have been considering getting one for their home!The best app to use with Alexa is IFTTT. You can have IFTTT add things to Google lists and calendars, trigger find your phone, create custom light settings for smart bulbs, and even set up an emergency trigger to text a loved one in an emergency. These features are all great for me since I live by myself. I definitely feel more secure being able to contact help if something should ever happen. Echo skills also expand the use of Alexa by adding trivia games, recipe apps, and searching for hotels, flights, and movies. One of my favorites is Milo, which allows you to search for movies or tv and find where it is offered on multiple services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.The only downside I have found is you have to be very specific with some commands, such as which music service you want to access or triggering IFTTT. But Amazon has recently updated the Alexa settings with the ability to change Spotify to your default music player, so a lot of the specificity is no longer needed!If you have connected home devices or live by yourself I would definitely recommend the Echo!

"The Echo is a great product, it was easy to set up and Alexa was answering questions in no time. There are several basic functions that the Echo is wonderful at: news, weather, music, time and timing. I love playing the Jeopardy game. I think that if I have anything to say on the ""down side"" it is that I had a higher expectation of the product's ability to search the internet for answers to some of my questions. Lots of my inquiries come back with the answer ""I did not understand that question"" or ""I'm sorry, I do not know the answer."" These are only a minor irritation/amusement. Overall, I am pleased with the product. Hopefully I will grow in my knowledge of the product and Echo will also grow in abilities through upgrades.","the echo is a great product, it was easy to set up and alexa was answering questions in no time. there are several basic functions that the echo is wonderful at news, weather, music, time and timing. i love playing the jeopardy game. i think that if i have anything to say on the down side it is that i had a higher expectation of the products ability to search the internet for answers to some of my questions. lots of my inquiries come back with the answer i did not understand that question or im sorry, i do not know the answer. these are only a minor irritationamusement. overall, i am pleased with the product. hopefully i will grow in my knowledge of the product and echo will also grow in abilities through upgrades.",4.0,2020-12-16,pre-inflation,0.9638,,,0.5719,,

"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like.

"The tablet was bought for a few family members, two of which have bought several Kindle books. But only the price is the only note worthy thing about it. If you buy it for 50 bucks, you have pay another 15 to remove the ads and since this is from Amazon, there is no Google Play to get more app selection.True, you can try to side load the Google Apps but the average tablet buyer won't do this. Also, the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the iPad Mini or other decent Android slates.

"I bought a first generation Kindle Fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. It took a bit of a beating and I had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. I think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the Fire HD 10 or something. So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. In the end, if you want a good e-reader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy. If you're looking for a serious small tablet, you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings.","i bought a first generation kindle fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. it took a bit of a beating and i had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. i think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the fire hd 10 or something. so my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. i also use a surface pro tablet as my personalwork computer, so that too probably color my opinion. out of the box this is lighter than the original. upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. in terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. games i had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new fire. webbrowsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. in the end, if you want a good ereader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy. if youre looking for a serious small tablet, you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings.",3.0,2022-12-18,post-inflation,0.9673,0.5737,0.0,0.5628,,-0.4588

"Let me set the stage for this review: I joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot... or at least what I would consider to be a lot, which is about 2 decently-long books a month.Up until buying the Paperwhite, I was doing most of my reading on my iPhone using the Kindle app. Long story short, I ended up returning the Paperwhite after about 2 weeks. Why? Because I realized just how sporadic my reading was. I read when I'm out and about, waiting at a doctor's office, or in-line at a restaurant, etc. It became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best E-Reader is the one you have with you at all times. For me, that's my iPhone.The actual reading experience is definitely better on the Paperwhite. However, if you're an ""on-the-go"" reader like me, then it just means you have to carry around another device. Dedicated E-Readers are for people who either truly read a ton, or have a set routine for reading. If that's not you, then stick with your phone.","let me set the stage for this review i joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot... or at least what i would consider to be a lot, which is about 2 decentlylong books a month.up until buying the paperwhite, i was doing most of my reading on my iphone using the kindle app. long story short, i ended up returning the paperwhite after about 2 weeks. why? because i realized just how sporadic my reading was. i read when im out and about, waiting at a doctors office, or inline at a restaurant, etc. it became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best ereader is the one you have with you at all times. for me, thats my iphone.the actual reading experience is definitely better on the paperwhite. however, if youre an onthego reader like me, then it just means you have to carry around another device. dedicated ereaders are for people who either truly read a ton, or have a set routine for reading. if thats not you, then stick with your phone.",3.0,2022-12-25,post-inflation,0.9493,,,,,0.0

"It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. Keep that in mind.If $50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????","its very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... i did not. so when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, i didnt rush to call. i have been taking care of seriously ill family members so i put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since i thought i had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which i didnt have. today my son was home sick, so i had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so i called amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps three times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only 49.99........ ok. after i calmly explained to he that that was full price and i wasnt about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me 10 off my next purchase.moral of the story, know before you buy if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo i guess.also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect since it wasnt on the box i found the amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. keep that in mind.if 50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????",1.0,2022-08-16,post-inflation,0.6961,0.42483333333333334,,,,0.2829333333333333

"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!","i went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. from the start i was on the phone every day for at least an hour with amazon tech support for one issue or another. most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. at one point i asked one of them about trying to save some ram and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didnt even know the difference between ram and regular storage. the internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. then a day would pass and id be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? come to find out its a known issue and theyre working on it. after two weeks of one thing after another i got fed up and just returned it. i wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. to me it was like walmart trying to build their own computer when theyre obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is amazon. if i were you id look at a regular android tablet from a reputable pc manufacturer, which is exactly what i did next. i got an asus tablet for only a few dollars more, and its unbelievable. 1000 better in comparison to the amazon fire hd8. save yourself the aggravation and go with asus or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. sorry amazon, not this time!",1.0,2022-12-25,post-inflation,0.9863,,0.242,0.4939,,0.26335

"It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it.

Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this.

"Bestbuy came through before the holiday better than Amazon--item available, arrived within 2 days, competitively priced. Great service there. My problem is with disappointing performance by Echo. Siri wins over Alexa. Issues encountered:1) a skill will be installed, but Alexa will tell me first, I need to install the skill and second, that the skill is already installed. User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky. Some pieces by classical composers will play only a few minutes of a selection, abruptly stop and begin a new piece. But some singers and ambient pieces will play for hours.Positives: flash briefing, weather, word definitions, Pandora access timer.","bestbuy came through before the holiday better than amazonitem available, arrived within 2 days, competitively priced. great service there. my problem is with disappointing performance by echo. siri wins over alexa. issues encountered1 a skill will be installed, but alexa will tell me first, i need to install the skill and second, that the skill is already installed. user is stuck in a doloop with no response.2 access to quick 1sentence read from wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask tell me more, alexas voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3 tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1time gimmicks. if you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills youve installed.4 responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with x and we have had instances where our correct response on jeopardy is reported as not correct. in one skill about a magic door ? a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. children can get frustrated quickly.5 access to music is quirky. some pieces by classical composers will play only a few minutes of a selection, abruptly stop and begin a new piece. but some singers and ambient pieces will play for hours.positives flash briefing, weather, word definitions, pandora access timer.",1.0,2022-12-25,post-inflation,-0.918,0.6808,,-0.7096,0.6808,0.6249

"Pros:- Amazon Prime works on it.- You can still sideload apps, like Kodi.Cons:- Not a good upgrade over the original Fire TV, is worse in some aspects.- Remote buttons are hard to press (compared to original Fire TV)- Remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix- Interface isn't as snappy as the original Fire TV- Same interface as the original Fire TV: There's still no good way to sort your apps or locate the Prime content that you want.- Voice search seems about the same as the original Fire TV. Alexa adds nothing significant. You still can't use it to search in 3rd party apps, like Youtube.- As for video decoding in Kodi, performance isn't much better than the original Fire TV. You will be able to play HEVC content at 1080p with no problem, but 1080p .264 hi10p (software-decoded) does not play well. There's simply not enough power. 4k decoding is hit-and miss.

"A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature.","a wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. i bought it primarily to use as a smart home control device. however, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. for instance, you cannot tell the echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. finding that out was incredible disappointing. i dont know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature.",2.0,2022-11-07,post-inflation,-0.525,,,,,

"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.","this kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. at the time i felt it was a steal at that price. the first tablet i purchased a few years ago was the original kindle fire, the following year i purchased an ipad mini and now have the ipad mini 4. as you may already know, the ipad does not have explandable memory. this kindle can have expanded memory to 200gb so that was a good selling point for me. after setting this new kindle fire up, i noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original ipad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenishyellowish tint to it. some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. im a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. i was not expecting perfection with the colors but peoples skin tones appeared greenish as if they were vulcans. i also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in pdf format. the kindle will read this format but the kindle fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc. it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. if you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. that was enough for me, ive been spoiled by the ease of use of the ipad and the display with accurate colors. back to the store for a prompt refund it went. overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an ipad for the reasons i am..you may be disappointed.",3.0,2022-07-07,post-inflation,0.0667,-0.4939,,0.2073,,
